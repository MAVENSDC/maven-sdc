This code uses IDL to create .png files of MAVENs orbit, where they can be viewed on the websites:

A rough outline of the steps:

1) Furnishes SPICE with the static files mar097s.bsp, de430s.bsp, pck00009.tpc, maven_v09.tf

2) Furnishes SPICE with the latest LSK, ORB, and SCLK files on the SDC

3) Determines the orbit number of the last PNG file generated by looking in the /maven/data/sdc/orbit_quicklooks directory

4) Creates PNGs of all new orbits using a combination of Dave Brain's code and the SPEDAS library

Depends on:
###########

- SPEDAS (/tools/spedas/*)
- ICY (/tools/icy/lib/icy.dlm)
- MAVEN Orbit files (/maven/data/anc/orb/*)
- SPICE files (/maven/data/anc/spice/*)

How to deploy:
##############

Put all the code into any directory on the SDC that has access to the above dependencies.  

###########
How to Run:
###########

Use the command:

	idl main.pro

The way the code is set up, it basically needs to be run periodically in order to function properly.

This is because it always reads the spice file "maven_orb_rec.orb", which always contains the latest few months of data.  

If the code isn't run for several months, there is a risk that the orbit file no longer contains the data we need.  

Set up on a cron to run weekly

Caveats:
########

This was basically tweaked with magic numbers specifically for running on the SDC.  When I run this same
code on my windows PC, the PNGs come out looking different. 

Dave had his code set up like this already, and it would be a somewhat intensive effort to ensure that this code was fully portable.
